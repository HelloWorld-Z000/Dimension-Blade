# Dimension Blade
it'll work with just vanilla MCO

this is the requirement or docs/readme stated by yrm.

MCO - needed

Simple Movement Keytrace - is easy to replicate, he uses this to get up down left right input for DAR

"NotEnoughEffects" in his patreon - can ignore, it seems he has created some vfx to go along 

TKDodge - can ignore

taunt animation - can ignore

Freestyle Katana Custom - can ignore

Optional addons such as my JCE and rapid slash - can ignore

YRM animated the weapon bone, the reason why I needed to hide the weapon via Static NIF Animated Behavior(I haven't done it in this dimension blade weapon)
