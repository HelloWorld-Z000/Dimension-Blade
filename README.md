# Dimension Blade


this is the docs inside yrm.
it'll work with just vanilla MCO

Simple Movement Keytrace - is easy to replicate, he uses this to get up down left right input for DAR

it seems he has created some vfx to go along called "NotEnoughEffects" in his patreon - can ignore
TKDodge - can ignore
taunt animation - can ignore
Freestyle Katana Custom - can ignore
Optional addons such as my JCE and rapid slash - can ignore

YRM animated the weapon bone, the reason why I needed to hide the weapon via Static NIF Animated Behavior(I haven't done it in this dimension blade weapon)
